Support spaces in identifiers

> Distance to friend's house = 100

Support units

> 100 hours

Support redefining otherwise-valid syntax/symbols

> hours = 20
> a to b = 100
> 10 hours + a to b == 300

What about this...

> Distnace to = 10
> to friend's = 20
> friend's house = 30
> Distance = 5
> Distance to friend's house
